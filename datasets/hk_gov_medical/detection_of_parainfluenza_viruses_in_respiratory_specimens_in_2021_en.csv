"1. For specimens received from 10 February 2014 onwards, molecular testing has replaced viral culture. Please interpret the data and trends in light of the enhanced sensitivity of molecular testing, and hence positive detection rates.",,,,,,,,,,,
2. Figures are subject to minor adjustments.,,,,,,,,,,,
3. Multiple specimens may have been received for testing from the same patient.,,,,,,,,,,,
