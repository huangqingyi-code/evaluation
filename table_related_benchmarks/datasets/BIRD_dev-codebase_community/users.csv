I spend my days in the coding dungeon and my tool of trade is R. I find it very useful for running simulations, doing data manipulation, statistics and shooting oneself in the foot (fortunes() pun intended). I am no stranger to field biology, where I mostly work with plants, butterflies and hoverflies.</p>

<p>I am also a PhD candidate in biostatistics at University of Ljubljana. I work with capture-mark recapture techniques and I fancy simulations, among other things.</p>

<p><strong>About Me</strong></p>

<p>I am a self-taught programmer mainly involved in <strong>PHP, MySQL, CSS/HTML, JavaScript/jQuery</strong> for around 4 years now. I have also worked with ASP 3.0, Java and PERL quite a bit. I like to code and develop in accordance with XHTML/CSS/Web standards, validated and cross-browser ready sites. I simply love PHP, JavaScript, JQuery and CSS. I  like to use state-of-the-art tools and techs and keep myself updated with latest stuff and am therefore always keen to learn new things and gain more and more knowledge because the thirst is <em>never</em> satisfied :)</p>

<p>If important information is missing, one can kindly ask for it. </p>

<p>Using a Dell Alienware laptop Quad-core system with 24 GB RAM and running Windows 8.1 Ultimate 64-bits plus an Alienware desktop PC with 6 cores, 32 GB RAM running Windows 8.1 Professional 64-bits with two 1920x1200 monitors to develop my own desktop applications, my own C# web applications, my own Python Apps for Google and for maintaining several of my own websites and domains. This is all just pure a hobby.  </p>

<p>BTW, I'm also a bit of an amateur at creating interesting CGI artwork, which basically means that I'm still keeping my art very simple. Less objects in the image generally means the rendering will be simpler and faster so as a result, some of my art is NSFW. Most is more like my gravatar. And some is pretty decent. :-) </p>

<br/>
I have three years of experience at a small start-up company which I would not suggest to everyone, but for those willing to teach themselves, it is an excellent opportunity.
<br/>
<br/>
I currently work in medical proton therapy as a systems engineer. Both the details of a functioning particle accelerator and the beam physics I work with keep me interested in the day to day of my job.
<br/>
<br/>
I am also currently pursuing a masters degree in electrical engineering.
<br/>
<br/>
I do not speak on behalf of my company, all views I express are my own.</p>

<b>ennuikiller</b> - a person who kills interminable boredom</p>

<p><p>About the avatar:
<p>It is in memory of 2 of the greatest geniuses of the 20th century (or perhaps in any century).  </p>

<p><p>1. Peter Sellers whose comic genius inspired a whole slew of successful comedians and what better accomplishment to leave to the world than laughter!!</p>

<p><p> 2.Stanley Kubrick whose films have been both iconoclastic and <b>profoundly humanistic</b> (I think some may have missed this point).  I believe his crowning achievement is in fact <b>Dr. Strangelove</b> who is pictured in the avatar.  A dark comedy (but with very serious overtones) about the ease with which the human species can eradicate itself.  If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and watch it RIGHT NOW!</p>

The extent to which mathematical thinking has affected subject has not been fully assessed yet, but the brain damage is known to be quite serious already. In particular, subject's ability to communicate with other programmers (such as his coworkers) is severely hampered by his tendency to talk about abstract concepts in terms of themselves rather than in terms of examples.</p>

<p>Subject has expressed hope that a language will be developed with the following features:</p>

<ol>
<li>as concise as GHC Haskell (at least for the non-proof parts of his programs)</li>
<li>as modular as Standard ML (also add applicative functors)</li>
<li>as pedantic about correctness as Coq (without the admit tactic)</li>
<li>compiles to native binaries as fast as C (with pointers marked as ""restrict"" whenever possible, and preferring direct system calls to libc calls)</li>
<li>a comprehensive standard library of data structures and algorithms, in the spirit of C++'s STL, but better</li>
</ol>

<p>Subject has been observed talking about what he calls ""deep"" analogies between type systems and database schemas. Subject has expressed dismay at the failure of major DBMS implementors to provide sufficiently expressive schemas, alleging that this failure forces him to encode certain business model constraints as database triggers, which he claims is ""time-consuming"" and ""error-prone"". Mentioning NoSQL in subject's presence must be avoided at all costs - subject may go on a rampage and cause both material destruction and loss of life.</p>

<p>Subject's outlook on life has been interestingly affected by recent developments, such as his exposure to the <a href=""http://www.rust-lang.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Rust programming language</a>, which he now claims has the potential to unify the mathematical elegance of Haskell with the performance focus of C and C++. Subject is probably the only Rust programmer trying to do purely functional programming in Rust. ""A Fortran programmer can write Fortran programs in any language. A Haskell programmer will dismiss any language he cannot write Haskell programs in."" Rust is one of the few languages subject has not dismissed so far. For some perspective on what this achievement means, especially for a C-family language, the list of languages subject has dismissed includes even the likes of Scala and F#.</p>

<p>Subject goes by the nick ""pyon"" on both Freenode and Mozilla's IRC network.</p>

<p>Just Another Genome Hacker,</p>

<p>Sadly, my most voted-up answer on Stackoverflow (312 votes) belonged to a question <a href=""http://stackoverflow.hewgill.com/questions/242/068/9.html"" rel=""nofollow"">that later got deleted.</a> The question came from a girl that asked for something cute that she could put on the icing of a birthday cake for her programmer boyfriend.</p>

<p>I suggested that, if her boyfriend is somewhat mathematically inclined, she write the following:</p>

<pre><code>    sin(t) â|cos(t)|
r = __________________  - 2 sin(t) + 2
    sin(t) + 7/5
</code></pre>

<p>If he doesn't get it at first, she could tease him with saying that it is obvious that he should take the polar plot of it. If he still doesn't get it, she should tell him to enter it in <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=polar%20r=%28sin%28t%29%2asqrt%28abs%28cos%28t%29%29%29%29/%28sin%28t%29%20%2b%207/5%29%20-2%2asin%28t%29%20%2b%202"" rel=""nofollow"">WolframAlpha</a>, that should yield the result:</p>

<p>Ceramic collector, obsessive cook, entrepreneur and professional geek.</p>

<p>I was doing a one-person consultancy for a couple of years, doing some Rails stuff, some .Net services work, and some work in Groovy/Java for a pharmaceutical firm called Dendreon. When that project wrapped up, I took a Rails-focused job at a hybrid Ruby/C# shop, Getty Images.</p>

<p>I'm interested in functional languages like Scala and F# but have relatively limited real-world experience with them.</p>

<p>In previous lives, I've worked for Microsoft, Revenue Science (now Audience Science), Zillow, and a travel company called Virtuoso, the Seattle Times, and a very strange financial/transportation conglomerate.</p>

<p>My long term professional ambition is to find a way to work from Tokyo/Kawasaki/Yokohama either 100% or via frequent travel or remote work opportunities. If you're interested in tracking down a reasonably competent Rails or ASP.net MVC guy and are located near Seattle, WA or Tokyo, Japan or don't mind me working mostly remotely, feel free to contact me.</p>

<p>I have lived in the netherlands until 2003 when I moved to the south of France in a little village called Felines Minervois filled with old and rusty wine makers. It was a charming place and I've really enjoyed living there. In 2005 I moved again to Vias, a bigger coastal village closer to what I call ""civilisation"".</p>

<p>As for work, Having both worked in sales and marketing I have an affinity for launching and promoting products. This is mixed with my love for entrepreneurship that has already lead me to the production and launch of the popular online product called iWebKit, available at <a href=""http://snippetspace.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://snippetspace.com</a> .</p>

<p>My past experienced combined with my business school study give me a head start for my future life. Speaking English, french and dutch my goal would be to work internationally and set up my own software or web service company later in life. This comes mainly for my love of Technology of all kind and the potential I see in that branch of business.</p>

<p>Long ago, I left home and joined the <a href=""http://www.marines.mil/"" rel=""nofollow"">United States Marine Corps</a> where I was assigned the Military Occupational Specialty of Basic Metal Worker (MOS 1316). I loved building things as a welder, but could not see myself doing this until I reached age 65.</p>

<p>After my Honorable Discharge in the early 1990s, I used my G.I. Bill to go to school and received my Bachelor of Science Degree in Physics four years later.</p>

<p>Using a love of computers since I played on a Commodore 64 at 10 years old and two (2) C++ electives that I had taken in school, I began working in the computer programming field.</p>

<p>The recession following ENRON in 2001 left me working at a remedial job for a little over two years while I brushed up on my skills at a local community college in SQL and first learned what the new .NET Framework was all about.</p>

<p>I have had the pleasure of working as a Software Developer since 2003.</p>

<p>For a short while, I pulled in a little extra income by running a moonlighting business under the name <a href=""http://www.joeswelding.biz"" rel=""nofollow"">Joe's Welding</a>. Dangerous working conditions and non-paying customers prompted me to sell my mobile welding equipment about the time my son was born.</p>

<p>Today, I am exclusively a Software Developer. My language of choice is C#, and I enjoy working with databases.</p>

For some reason instead of getting NES or PS, i've got Sinclair ZX for New Year Eve and after a while I got really excited with what you can get, writing number lines of code.</p>

<p>I tried and played with a lot of stuff including prolog, lisp, c , turbo pascal, delphi, basic, bash, javascript, vb, vbscript</p>

<p>I truly love javascript and really like where is it moving last 5 years.</p>

<p>I'm working mainly on three platforms</p>

<ul>
<li>.net (c#, iis, asp.net, sql server, wcf etc)</li>
<li>MEAN stack (javascript, node.js, express.js, mongo, angular.js)</li>
<li>Python (flask, web.py)</li>
</ul>

<p>After trying and playing with number of client-side MV** frameworks, I stick with angular.js for now, waiting when polymer/platform became more stable.</p>

<p>However later I'm trying to step back from angular and do something similar to basecamp next approach, when again you render html on the server side.</p>

<p>Funny to say but I see later (polymer) like client side asp.net. </p>

<p>I've got MSPD .net 4.0 Web Developer certification (MCTS WCF 4.0, ADO.NET 4.0, ASP.NET 4.0)</p>

<p>My story with JS started with IE6 and client side calculators for totaling clients expenses on pre-print media, that was quite long time ago, when there was no AJAX buzz word.  I moved to jquery, RICO, prototype and back to jquery, and was using mostly it since version 1.2. Also I was using ASP.NET AJAX for almost 10 years and find it to be quite under-valued framework.</p>

<p>I'm collecting 30 lines or less javascript examples, feel free to add yours <a href=""http://30lines.info"" rel=""nofollow"">http://30lines.info</a></p>

<p>I am a postdoc in philosophy.</p>

<p>I contribute to a blog for philosophers who use LaTeX. If you fall in to that niche, check it out: <a href=""http://www.charlietanksley.net/philtex/"" rel=""nofollow"">PhilTeX</a>. (The blog will be of use to all kind of humanities scholars using LaTeX, I imagine, but it was started by, and is run by philosophers...) The blog is currently defunct, but may be resurrected soon.</p>

<p>I made this <a href=""https://github.com/scmbradley/Beamer-colour-change-project"" rel=""nofollow"">beamer colour change package</a> that slowly changes the colour of structure elements of beamer presentations. Feedback welcome.
I also made this <a href=""https://github.com/scmbradley/moreenum"" rel=""nofollow""><code>moreenum</code></a> package which adds new enumeration options.
The <a href=""http://www.seamusbradley.net/tex.html"" rel=""nofollow"">TeX goodies</a> page of my website includes some other bits and bobs I've done.</p>

<p>Feel free to stalk my Internet name(s) if you wish - it's how I make most of my closest contacts these days. Just note that I don't really believe in social constructs when they get in the way of satisficing (or in the way of my goal of learning as much as possible). </p>

<p>Don't take anything I say/do too seriously.  A lot of the things I do (that may look weird/stupid on the outside) are the types of things that help me adjust my posterior probability of various things - especially low probability events.Sometimes I hit on a jackpot/very interesting idea. I'm kind of messy since it helps facilitate creative destruction.</p>

<p>I have <em>a lot</em> of respect for <em>all</em> of the sciences. Tactically, I'm developing heuristics for rationality, impartiality, anti-laziness, and creation+identification+searching for what's relevant+reliable. Strategically, I just want to learn everything.</p>

<p>A lot of my thought processes involve my creating new hypotheses and refuting them on my own. I still document the thought process since it's important and may be important for future ""true"" hypotheses.</p>

I started programming when I was 10 after seeing SHRDLU on television... watching a robotic arm understand and correctly react to the command âPick up a big red blockâ is a moment forever burned in my memory. Not long after that I played Intellivision at my cousin Mattâs house which occupied countless hours of my youth. I was never satisfied with simply playing the games, I wanted to know what was going on behind the scenes. At the same time my parents gave me my first computer: a TI99/4A, and my passion for creating software took root. The first program I wrote was not ""Hello World"", it was a chatter bot. I coded many games on that machine, including a Wizardry clone, which I would trade (via audio cassettes) with my like minded schoolmates.</p>

<p>Since then I've worked for a Fortune 500 company (AutoZone), an iconic American company (Yankee Candle), an indie game company making games for the blind (All inPlay), and I even took a stab at my company creating artificial intelligence tools and educational software. </p>

<p>I've been coding for almost 30 years - 19 professionally - and I love that I ""work"" in a profession where every day I learn something new and have the potential to change lives, heck, there are a couple marriges and even kids that resulted from some of my work at All inPlay.</p>

Well, let's say starting then I always tried to expand my knowledge. While I still am not a typical wizard at some topic, I believe I have collected a fair amount of knowledge over various areas. </p>

<p>These includes all of the three major desktop operating systems being used those days (with Windows being the least favored one and all Linux distributions counted as one single systems), as well as quite a lot of programming languages. </p>

<p>In my later years I decided to study mathematics, which helped me to sharpen my logical reasoning and develop a toolset of problem solving methods.</p>

<p>In 2011 I finished my M. Sc. in Maths and started working as a data- and process analyst at one of Germany's major companies. </p>

<p>In parallel I am working part-time on my PhD, researching one practical application for B-Splines and the methods that can be used for that. </p>

<p>Right now the languages and applications I use frequently are MATLAB, R and C++, as well as LaTeX, if one wants to call that a programming language (well, it's Turing-complete, isn't it?). Furthermore, I started getting used to Emacs and loving it - here, though, I'm only scratching on the surface.</p>

M$ had this great idea to just integrate all of its software so that they would all work together seamlessly. This would be great for users of this software since this would make doing things like importing a webpage in a Ward processing (because in magicland we have wards instead of words) document, seemlessly and natively.</p>

<p>But this would evidently make the software too good. And we cant have people getting software that is too good. Because then if another company came along with their own version of good software people will be too dumb to install and use that if they have the already integrated versions that were included. So the Neanderthal Union decreed that M$ was using its magical abilities to make things too difficult for smaller developers to create super complex applications that they must give away for free. And said you will no longer make things work together seemlessly.</p>

<p>And instead of extending their middle wand to the NeU and saying fine we shall no longer make software that can be used in the NeU... M$ bowed before the luddites and said ok. So now you can not rename a file from inside of your office productivity suite in Magicland.</p>
