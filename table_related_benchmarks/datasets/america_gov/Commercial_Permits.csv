The proposed project would relocate the residential student population to a single new building. The new Residence Hall project is located within the interior on the Northwestern end of the school campus and on the East side of the football field. The building is sited to align with the adjacent Student Center building and to be on center with the Chapel to the East. The new building will house the entire residential student population about a one quarter of the entire school population under one roof. The proposed building is five-story with a basement and 82,000 square foot structure. A lower level shall be constructed below grade to house mechanical, electrical, plumbing and security equipment as well as storage for the building occupants. The Georgian style architecture of the campus influences the design of the new residence hall Project. Red brick and cast stone detailing and a synthetic slate roof will be consistent with the existing campus buildings. The primary structure of the foundation, slab on grade, floors and columns is concrete with supplement steel and light gage roof framing. The steel and light gage roof framing are protected with gypsum board fire rated assemblies as required for Construction Type IB. The exterior wall assemblies shall comply with NFPA 285. The first floor will include an infirmary, dorm related faculty offices, a common student lounge and a tiered assembly room. The 1st floor kitchen provides a dining area for special events with a smaller group of residents. An existing main campus dining facility is located elsewhere on campus.
